# Adventure Story

## Introduction 

Adventure story was created to bring back childhood memories. As a child I hated to read books but loved books that gave me options on how the story went. I liked how I could read it over and over again and get to a different ending everytime.

The main aim of this project was to give an adult their memories back, to play a fun but potenitally scary game, through reading and just answering a few questions.

Most games have no meaning behind them, like battleships for example, you just have to guess where they are. However with this game you are reading which is great for your mind and having fun in the proccess.
